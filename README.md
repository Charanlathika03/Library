# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
# DATE:15/11/25
# AIM

To study and understand the functional requirements and workflow of a Library Management System using Software Requirement Specification (SRS).

# SRS (Procedure)
# 1. Introduction

A Library Management System (LMS) is software designed to automate the management of books, members, book issues, returns, fines, and overall library operations.

# 2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

Maintain records of books

Help members borrow and return books

Assist librarians/staff in managing library operations

Provide faster search and easy access to information

# 3. Scope

This system covers:

Book catalog management

Member registration

Issuing and returning books

Fine calculation

Staff and librarian operations

Report generation

# 4. Functional Requirements

The system must store details of books and members.

Members should be able to borrow and return books.

Librarian should add, update, and remove book records.

System must calculate fines for overdue returns.

Staff should manage issue/return operations.

# 5. Non-Functional Requirements

Security: Only authorized users can modify data.

Usability: Interface should be simple and easy to use.

Efficiency: Quick searching and processing.

Reliability: Accurate records with no data loss.

# 6. Assumptions

Each member has a valid library ID.

Books must be returned on or before the due date.

Staff and librarian have different access levels.

# RESULT
The Library Management System was successfully analyzed and documented.
All functional and non-functional requirements were identified, and the workflow of book and member management was clearly defined. The experiment demonstrates how LMS improves efficiency in issuing books, returning books, calculating fines, and maintaining library records.
